# How to...

## ... get an Escornabot? 

At the moment, you have to build your own one. It implies that you will earn some [DIY karma][DIY01] and you can be sure that there is no better price in the market.

However, we have initiatives like [*Travelling Family*][TRA01] that can bring you borrowed Escornabots for free.


## ... build my Escornabot?

Building an Escornabot is fun and we hope you will learn a lot making it and playing with it, but, first, you must choose your flavour!

### *Brivoi audacius*
Do you want to learn the most about how a robot works? Would you sacrifice some time and effort to build the most **DIY** version of the escornabot? This is the right choice for you!

#### Pros:
1. Pure DIY version, more fun, more learning!
2. More common parts and easier to reuse.

#### Cons:
1. Building and wiring is a bit messier.

### *Brivoi compactus*
Are you going to build quite a few robots? Do you feel comfortable ordering [PCB'S][PCB01] to an external service? (if you are not, don be afraid, it's not so hard) Do you want an easier and faster to build version? *Brivoi compactus*  is waiting for you!

#### Pros:
1. Easier and faster to solder.
2. Almost no wiring.
3. More compact design.

#### Cons:
1. PCB orders usually start with ten units.
2. More parts and a little less ordinary.

### *Placidus*
Do you already have an Escornabot? Have you been called geek more than ten times in your life? Do you have a taste for BIG things? You will probably want to build *placidus*, our outdated version, a design that we love but that has been overruled by the *Brivoi* individuals. It's evolution, baby!

#### Pros
1. We learned a lot with it.
2. It works fine.

#### Cons
Ok, it's our first child, we would never say bad things about it, such as:

1. It's too big.
2. Takes longer to print.
3. Takes much longer to build.
4. It moves kind of slower.
